#  Learning Path Recommender

##  Overview
The **Learning Path Recommender** is a simple educational application that generates a personalized learning roadmap based on a user’s current skill level, target career goal, and available study time.

The project demonstrates how structured learning paths can be created using rule-based logic to help learners plan their studies efficiently.

##  Problem Statement
Many learners struggle to decide:
- What to learn next
- In what order to learn skills
- How long it will take to reach a goal

This project addresses the problem by recommending an optimized learning path with time estimation and progress tracking.

##  How It Works
1. The user selects:
   - Current skill level
   - Target role
   - Available study hours per week
2. The system:
   - Identifies a predefined learning path for the chosen goal
   - Calculates total learning hours
   - Estimates the number of weeks required
3. The user can track progress using a progress slider.
